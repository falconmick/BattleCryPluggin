## Anyfin Can Lethal - A plugin for Hearthstone Deck Tracker

[Download stable](https://github.com/falconmick/BattleCryPluggin/raw/master/dist/BattleCryPlugin%20v0.0.1.zip)

Currently in early development. All you have to do is extract the zip into your pluggin folder
Then you go into Options -> Tracker -> Pluggins -> Battle Cry -> Enable

## Working

* Play SFX on either your or your oponents play
* Time Delay

## Current BattleCry SFX

* Mysterious Challenger

## Needs to be done

* Change HardCoded mp3 to card mapper to be done via xml or csv (so anyone can make any sfx on battlecry)
* Add Other events, like on draw, on death, on win/loose game
* Fix the time delay as currently it locks the entire thread

## Contributing

Currently as this is still early I doubt I will want any contribs other than anything you notice wrong + bugs, but as I have the basic functionality to calculate lethal I will probably look for comunity improvements.
