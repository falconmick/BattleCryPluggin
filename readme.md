## BattleCry - A plugin for Hearthstone Deck Tracker

[Download stable](https://github.com/falconmick/BattleCryPluggin/raw/master/dist/BattleCryPlugin%20v0.0.4.zip)

Currently in early development. All you have to do is extract the zip into your pluggin folder
Then you go into Options -> Tracker -> Pluggins -> Battle Cry -> Enable

If you want to customise what card triggers what sound go into the AudioFiles directory inside of pluggins and modify cardsoundconfig.xml
to add another, coppy the SoundPlaySetting node and modify:
* FileName: what file (relitive to AudioFiles directory) do you want to play
* CardId: what CardId is it (see [here](https://github.com/falconmick/BattleCryPluggin/blob/master/dist/cardDB.enUS.xml) for card list)
* Delay: How long to wait until playing audio file
* CardSource: 'All' to play it if either player plays it
* CardSource: 'Player' to play it ONLY when you play a card
* CardSource: 'Opponent' to play it ONLY when your opponent plays a card

## Working

* Play SFX on either your or your oponents play
* Time Delay

## Current BattleCry SFX

* Mysterious Challenger

## Needs to be done

* Add Other events, like on draw, on death, on win/loose game
* Add menu option to add/remove sounds for when you play a card

## Contributing

Currently as this is still early I doubt I will want any contribs other than anything you notice wrong + bugs, but as I have the basic functionality to calculate lethal I will probably look for comunity improvements.
